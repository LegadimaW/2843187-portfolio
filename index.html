            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Im Wilson Legadima, a Computer Science student from South Africa with hands-on experience building full-stack, database-driven applications. I work mainly on the backend, where I focus on writing clear logic, designing efficient SQL databases, and building secure, reliable systems. Ive worked with PHP, MySQL, Python, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. Im always curious about how things work under the hood and continuously strive to improve my skills especially in backend development, cloud computing and security.  Ive always been fascinated about computers and what is it to code hence im doing computer science for the MONEY. Learned a lot during this lab. COMS is lovely. I like it too much. </p>
            <p>I love Coding and Git</p>

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                I recently built a secure, database-driven event management web application using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript.
                The system allows users to create accounts, post events, and manage invitations while maintaining proper
                authentication and session security. I focused on efficient SQL queries, clean backend logic, and a responsive
                interface styled with Tailwind CSS. This project strengthened my understanding of full-stack development,
                access control, and real-world client server communication.
